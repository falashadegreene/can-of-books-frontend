## Getting Started

- Clone this repository using `git clone`
- Run `npm install`
- Add your API key to `env.sample`
- Run `npm start`

## Architecture

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, MongoAtlas.

# Team Agreement

## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate? EB - until 9pm. FG - until 9:30pm.

- What platform will you use to communicate Slack.

- How often will you take breaks? As needed. We'll check in with each on the hour and decide whether to take a 10 min break.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Ask for help from our instructors.


## How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Our strengths overlap, so we can motivate each other to develop our front-end skills. We also have similar weaknesses (asking for help), so we can recognize that in each other and reach out for help!

## In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- FG. Public speaking. Asking for help.
- EB. Handling ambiguity. Taking initiative on tasks that I don't fully understand.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the 

## day-to-day development?

- Discuss our game plan at the beginning of every lab, and do a code review.
- Conflict Resolution

## What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Revisit our team agreement and have an open dialogue.

## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Communicate. We'll discuss in the daily lab meeting.

## How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Communicate issues frequently on completion of tasks. We'll rely on our strengths, and focus on the fact 
- that we're both here to learn, and we're learning together. Create an open environment.
