**Author**: Falashade, Elizabeth
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

# Team Agreement

## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate? EB - until 9pm. FG - until 9:30pm.

- What platform will you use to communicate Slack.

- How often will you take breaks? As needed. We'll check in with each on the hour and decide whether to take a 10 min break.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Ask for help from our instructors.

## Cooperative

Make a list of each parsonâ€™s strengths.

- EB. Front-end, CSS, design, details, catching errors.
- FG. Vanilla CSS, HTML. Resourceful: finding answers on Google.

## How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Our strengths overlap, so we can motivate each other to develop our front-end skills. We also have similar weaknesses (asking for help), so we can recognize that in each other and reach out for help!

## In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- FG. Public speaking. Asking for help.
- EB. Handling ambiguity. Taking initiative on tasks that I don't fully understand.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the 

## day-to-day development?

- Discuss our game plan at the beginning of every lab, and do a code review.
- Conflict Resolution

## What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Revisit our team agreement and have an open dialogue.

## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Communicate. We'll discuss in the daily lab meeting.

## How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Communicate issues frequently on completion of tasks. We'll rely on our strengths, and focus on the fact 
- that we're both here to learn, and we're learning together. Create an open environment.
